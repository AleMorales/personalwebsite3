I am a lecturer at the [Centre for Crop Systems Analysis](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Centre-for-Crop-Systems-Analysis.htm) at Wageningen University & Research, specialized on the application of computational methods to understand and predict the relationship between crops and their environment. My focus is on teaching and the development of software and computational methods for research. I am an experienced R and Julia programmer, with some knowledge of C++, with which I have built several projects. On this site I post articles of an educational/tutorial nature where I described (with some depth) some of the ideas that I use in my research and teaching that are less commonly available online.
